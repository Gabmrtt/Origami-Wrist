# Origami-Wrist Study

The following reopositery contains all the codes used for the semester project I undertook at the Robotic Reconfigurable Laboratory - EPFL. 

The project contained an important part regarding data collection as the architecture of the robot required a special setup to efficiently gather data. 

In a second time, data are being processed in order to extract valuable insights to better characterize the robot. 

If there is any doubts regarding any of the codes presented here, do not hesitate to contact me at gabriel.muret@epfl.ch.
