# Origami-Wrist Study

The following repositery contains all  codes used for the semester project I undertook at the Robotic Reconfigurable Laboratory - EPFL. 
The purpose of this project has been to collect data on a soft robotic structure while activating different types of actuators, to then create a neural network in order to generalize the predictions, and to characterize the actuators effect.

The project contained an important part regarding data collection as the architecture of the robot required a special setup to efficiently gather data. 

In a second time, data are being processed in order to extract valuable insights to better characterize the robot. 

If there is any doubts regarding any of the codes presented here, do not hesitate to contact me at gabriel.muret@epfl.ch.
